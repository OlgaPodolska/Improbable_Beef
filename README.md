# Improbable_Beef
JavaScript charts to visualize bacterium biodiversity study

# Overview of Project

I created engaging and dynamic charts with Plotly to share the information about bacterias used to product synthetic beef meat. Major task in her project: to create a dashboard in which project's volunteers can select their anonymized ID from a dropdown menu in the browser in order to display information about their belly button critters.

Microbiological startup “Improbable Beef” discovered the bacteria with ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef.  This microorganism can supply next best taste of food, and apparently lives in a human belly button. The company needs volunteers who will take participation in the discovery: between individuals quantity of bacterial species may vary even in the same location. Each person’s identity is anonymous, but the data you can see at this site.  

JavaScript
Plotly
D3.js

Originally data was stored in the JavaScript file as array:

# Results

Dynamic site: <a href="https://olgapodolska.github.io/Improbable_Beef/index.html">Belly Button Biodeversity Dashboard</a>

Now we have the new fully functional webpage, where volunteers can search their results of bacterium biodiversity study and see visualized results in the different charts.

1. Horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) found per sample

2. Bubble chart that to display the divercity of bacteria cultures per sample

3. Gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value

4. For the better visability I customized the dashboard:

* Added the image to the jumbotron
* Changed background color
* Used a custom color for font with contrast for the background
* Added more information about the project 
* Created the additional space between the charts

Now the site is interactive and can display the all charts according to their requirements!
