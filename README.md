JavaScript charts to visualize bacterium biodiversity study

I created engaging and dynamic charts with Plitly to share the information with my audience in the best way. For volunteers who are interested in selling their bacteria to Improbable Beef, what is the best way to visualize the types of bacteria that colonize their bellies? Some of them will be suitable for synthetic beef production, while others will not.

major task in her project: to create a dashboard in which her volunteers can select their anonymized ID from a dropdown menu in the browser in order to display information about their belly button critters.
