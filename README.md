# Improbable_Beef
JavaScript charts to visualize bacterium biodiversity study

# Overview of Project

I created engaging and dynamic charts with Plotly to share the information about bacterias used to product synthetic beef meat. Major task in her project: to create a dashboard in which project's volunteers can select their anonymized ID from a dropdown menu in the browser in order to display information about their belly button critters.

Originally data was stored in the JavaScript file as array:

Now we have the new fully functional webpage, where volunteers can search their results of bacterium biodiversity study and see visualized results in the different charts.

1. Horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) found per sample

2. Bubble chart that to display the divercity of bacteria cultures per sample
